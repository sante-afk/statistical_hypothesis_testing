## Statistical Hypothesis Testing

This work implements methods of statistical hypothesis testing using the R language.

#### Contents:
**Testing hypotheses about parameters:**
- Hypothesis about the mean (one-sample Student's t-test).  
- Hypothesis about the equality of the means of two independent samples (Student's/Welch's t-test).  
- Hypothesis about the equality of variances (Fisher's test).  
- Testing hypotheses using nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon test).  
- Assessing the statistical significance of differences based on tabulated data.  

**Testing hypotheses about the distribution law:**
- Testing the normality of distribution (Shapiro–Wilk, Kolmogorov, Lilliefors, x^2).  

#### Data visualization:
- Histograms, boxplots, QQ plots, density plots.  
- Testing normality on the built-in `trees` and `airquality` datasets.  
- Generating random samples and analyzing them.  

#### Main tools:
- Built-in datasets: `trees`, `sleep`, `airquality`.  
- Statistical criteria: t-test, Fisher’s test, Wilcoxon test, x^2, Shapiro–Wilk, Lilliefors.  
- Visualization tools: histograms, boxplots, QQ plots, density plots.
